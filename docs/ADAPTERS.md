# Writing a Triad adapter — plug any assistant CLI into the protocol

Triad never talks to an assistant directly: the engine (`scripts/pair.sh`)
dispatches every call through an **adapter** — one bash file per assistant at
`adapters/<name>.sh` (installed to `<scripts-dir>/pair-adapters/<name>.sh`).
To plug in a new CLI you write one adapter file. You do not need to read the
engine source; this contract is complete.

## Quick start

```bash
cp adapters/template.sh adapters/mycli.sh   # then edit the placeholders
bash -n adapters/mycli.sh                   # syntax
bash tests/smoke.sh                         # engine still healthy
PAIR_ARCHITECT=codex PAIR_IMPLEMENTER=mycli bash scripts/pair.sh init "<brief>"
```

## Naming

- The adapter's filename (minus `.sh`) is the agent name used everywhere:
  role env vars (`PAIR_IMPLEMENTER=mycli`), `state.json` `.roles`, installer
  `--agents`.
- Names must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. The engine validates this before
  sourcing the file — it is what makes the `"${name}_consult"`-style dispatch
  safe. Uppercase, dots, or dashes are rejected.

## The contract

An adapter is a bash fragment that is **sourced** by pair.sh and install.sh.
It must define, replacing `<name>` with the adapter name:

| Symbol | Kind | Required for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<name>_display` | string variable | always | Human-readable display name; used in prompts and `### <Agent> — <timestamp>` attribution headers |
| `<name>_check` | function | installer | Print one line of version/status info; nonzero exit = CLI not usable |
| `<name>_consult` | function | architect role | Read-only consultation: intake, questions, rulings, fallback reviews |
| `<name>_implement` | function | implementer / junior roles | Task execution: may edit files and run commands |
| `<name>_review` | function | optional | Native review command (e.g. `codex review`); without it the engine falls back to `_consult` with the diff embedded |
| `<name>_install` | function | optional | Installer hook for per-agent setup (config, skills, policy rules) |

A role is grantable only if the capability exists: architect needs
`_consult`, implementer and junior need `_implement`. The engine enforces
this (`agent 'x' cannot hold the <role> role`).

### Call signature (consult / implement / review)

```
<name>_consult  OUTFILE SESSION_ID PROMPT
<name>_implement OUTFILE SESSION_ID PROMPT
<name>_review   OUTFILE SESSION_ID PROMPT
```

- `OUTFILE` — write the assistant's **reply text** here (overwrite, not append
  — except `_review`, which appends to a file that already has an attribution
  header).
- `SESSION_ID` — empty string = start a fresh session; non-empty = resume that
  session. If a supplied id definitely does not exist, return reserved code 3;
  the engine performs the checkpointed fresh retry.
- `PROMPT` — the full prompt, passed as one argument. Pass it to your CLI
  exactly (quote it; never let the shell expand its contents).

### stdout discipline (the one rule people get wrong)

`_consult` and `_implement` must print **exactly one thing to stdout: the
session id** (the new one if the CLI minted one, otherwise the id you were
given; may be empty if the CLI is sessionless). The engine captures stdout
with `$(...)` and stores it in `state.json`. ALL other output — progress,
warnings, CLI noise — must go to stderr or be swallowed. A stray `echo`
corrupts session tracking.

Return nonzero on failure and leave whatever the CLI produced in `OUTFILE`
(the engine keeps it for diagnosis and dies with a pointer to it).

Exit code `3` is reserved for a precise **session id not found / cannot
resume** condition. Only return `3` when the prompt definitely did not run;
the engine will checkpoint the dead session and attempt one fresh
architect/implementer call. Return any other nonzero code for ordinary CLI,
model, permission, or task failures. The junior lane is never retried.

### Optional context telemetry sidecar

Before a consult, implement, or native-review dispatch, the engine makes
`PAIR_USAGE_FILE` available to the adapter as an empty temporary-file path.
It is deliberately not exported to the assistant CLI child process. An
adapter may write one JSON object there after parsing the CLI response;
adapters that ignore it remain fully compatible.

```json
{
  "last_input_tokens": 84210,
  "context_window": 200000,
  "call_total_tokens": 426000,
  "cached_input_tokens": 391000,
  "tool_calls": 17
}
```

Every field is optional, numeric, non-negative, and describes the completed
dispatch. Meanings are deliberately separate:

- `last_input_tokens`: resident input on the final model inference; this is
  the context-pressure signal, not cumulative spend.
- `context_window`: active model window for that final inference.
- `call_total_tokens`: raw tokens consumed by the whole dispatch, including
  any internal tool iterations.
- `cached_input_tokens`: cached-input slice of that dispatch.
- `tool_calls`: tool calls made inside that dispatch.

Do not print telemetry to stdout and do not put prompt/reply text, secrets, or
credentials in the sidecar. Invalid JSON or invalid fields are ignored and the
engine falls back to a conservative prompt/reply-size estimate. A partial
sidecar is valid: for example, reporting only `call_total_tokens` improves
spend accounting while resident context remains estimated. The engine owns
policy and rollover decisions; adapters only report measurements.

Shipped telemetry coverage is deliberately best-effort: Claude parses
`usage.iterations`, Codex parses JSONL `turn.completed`, and Qwen/OpenCode
write a sidecar only when their result events include recognized usage fields.
Native review commands without structured usage fall back to estimation.

The engine sanity-clamps `last_input_tokens`: a value above the reported
`context_window` (or above any plausible model window) is treated as
cumulative spend misreported as residency and the engine falls back to its
estimate for context pressure. If your CLI only exposes cumulative usage,
report it as `call_total_tokens` and omit `last_input_tokens`.

### Optional driver-lane telemetry hook

```
<name>_driver_usage USAGE_OUT
```

The engine also meters the **driver** — the interactive session *running*
pair.sh (usually the orchestrating architect), which the engine never
launches and cannot query through the call sidecar. If the adapter for the
presumed driver agent defines `<name>_driver_usage`, the engine calls it on
every subcommand (cwd = the project root) instead of estimating. Write the
same sidecar JSON object to `USAGE_OUT` (`last_input_tokens` required;
`context_window` / `cached_input_tokens` optional) describing the *live
interactive session for this project*, and return nonzero when you cannot
tell (the engine then falls back to its estimate — never guess).

Reference: `adapters/codex.sh` `codex_driver_usage` reads the freshest local
Codex rollout JSONL whose recorded `cwd` matches the project and extracts the
last `token_count` event — a bounded local file read; no network, no quota,
no prompt content. The same rules apply here: numeric fields only, never
prompts, secrets, or environment values.

### Source-time rules

- **No side effects at source time.** The file is sourced by both pair.sh and
  install.sh before any decision is made — top-level code must only define
  variables and functions. No mktemp, no network, no writes.
- Helpers are fine; prefix them with `<name>__` (double underscore) to avoid
  collisions, e.g. `mycli__bin()`.
- Read configuration from env vars named `PAIR_<NAME>_*`
  (e.g. `PAIR_MYCLI_BIN`, `PAIR_MYCLI_MODEL`) with sane defaults inside the
  functions, not at the top level.

### `_install` hook

Called as `<name>_install KIT_DIR PAIR_SH` from install.sh, which provides
the helpers `say`, `ok`, `warn`, `confirm` (respects `--yes`) and
`render` (substitutes `__PAIR_SH__` in doc templates from
`agents/<name>/`). Return nonzero to abort the install. Keep every
machine-level change behind `confirm`.

## Semantics per role

- **Architect** (`_consult`): the engine's prompts instruct the model to be
  read-only, but enforce it too if your CLI can (sandbox flag, restricted
  tool list — see `adapters/codex.sh` `-s read-only`, `adapters/claude.sh`
  consult lane `Read,Glob,Grep`). An architect that silently edits files
  breaks the protocol's audit trail.
- **Implementer** (`_implement`): grant edit + shell capabilities
  (`adapters/claude.sh` uses `--permission-mode acceptEdits` with a Bash
  grant; `adapters/qwen.sh` uses `--approval-mode yolo`). Headless defaults
  of most CLIs deny writes — find your CLI's equivalent or tasks will
  "succeed" without changing any file.
- **Junior** (`_implement`, same function): identical mechanics; the
  human-approval gate (exact task match, consume-before-launch) is role logic
  inside the engine. **Do not** reimplement or relax it in an adapter.

## Reference implementations

- `adapters/codex.sh` — session id captured from a JSONL event stream; native
  `_review`; installer hook with sandbox/config/policy setup.
- `adapters/claude.sh` — one CLI serving two roles with different permission
  lanes; resume mints a *new* session id each call (echoed back, engine
  persists it).
- `adapters/qwen.sh` — JSON event-*array* output parsing; binary addressed by
  absolute path because it's not on non-login-shell PATH; one CLI in two lanes
  via `--approval-mode` (`default` = read-only consult — which also enables
  semantic checkpoints when qwen implements — `yolo` = write).
- `adapters/opencode.sh` — JSONL (one event per line — parse with plain `jq`
  filters, no array indexing) where the reply is split across *multiple*
  `type=="text"` events that must be concatenated in order (`jq -rj`);
  session id read from `.sessionID` (present on every event); one CLI in two
  lanes via different flags (`--agent plan` = read-only consult,
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` = write); no native review → generic
  fallback. Env: `PAIR_OPENCODE_BIN`, `PAIR_OPENCODE_MODEL` (`-m
  provider/model` passthrough).
- `adapters/template.sh` — commented skeleton to copy.

The output-shape lesson from the reference set: know whether your CLI emits a
JSON **array** (qwen — needs `jq '[.[] | select(...)]'`), **JSONL** (codex,
opencode — plain `jq 'select(...)'` per line), or a **single object** (claude)
— and whether the reply is one field or split across events.

## Testing without burning quota

`tests/mocks/` contains fake `codex`/`claude`/`qwen` binaries that emit each
CLI's real JSON shapes. For a new adapter, add a mock that mimics your CLI's
output format and a smoke case in `tests/smoke.sh` (the existing cases show
the pattern: run pair.sh against the mock, assert on `state.json` and
`$MOCK_LOG`). `bash tests/smoke.sh` must pass before you ship an adapter.
